	<h2>Symptoms of depression?</h2>
	<p>Depression entails much more that just feeling somber or unhappy. To help you discover all symptoms of depression, we dedicated an article to the deeper meaning of the symptoms of depression. You can namely find the recognized symptoms of depression on numerous websites, but what do these symptoms entail? How does one interpret them?</p>
	<p>To give an overview of the symptoms of depression, we have based this article on the DSM (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders) which states the symptoms of depression. which we then describe more thoroughly. The DSM is a diagnostic manual, used by American insurance companies in order to be able to set the ‘diagnosis’ depression. This manual is used by most psychiatrists for setting a diagnosis, too.</p>
	<p>We hereby want to state that a ‘diagnosis’ of depression should not affect your input in healing. If you have just 4 symptoms while the DSM says you need 5 for a diagnosis, you should not blindly focus on this, but instead know that you can take steps to healing anyway. You can treat your suffering, with or without a diagnosis.</p>
	<p>In this article we will divide up the psychological symptoms of depression and physical symptoms of depression, so that you get a clear image of the way in which the body and mind are connected.</p>
