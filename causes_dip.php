<h2>Causes of depression?</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, body and mind work together and can add hormones to the development and presence of a depression. Hormones are not the only cause which can partake in the development of depression. below, we give an overview of these categories.</p>
<p>While you go through the categories, keep in mind that each depression is different and that they thus can all have different causes. A depression can develop due to a combination of causes, but even through the strong experience of one cause. That is why you should read the categories with an open mind.</p>
<p>The two large categories of causes of depression are genetic causes of depression and situational causes of depression. Under genetic causes of depression, we categorize the causes of depression which are present from birth. Genetic causes of depression are also sometimes called the vulnerable causes of depression, because genetic causes of depression can make us vulnerable to the development of a depression, but they will not always lead to the development of a depression.</p>
<p>Under situational causes of depression we consider the causes of depression which take place in our mind, body, and surroundings. It namely is so that not everyone will develop a depression, because people react differently with their mind and body to intensive situations.</p>
