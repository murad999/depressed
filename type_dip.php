	<h2>Types of depression?</h2>
	<p>Depression can develop in different ways. At the hand of a diagnosis and the experience of depression symptoms, we can differentiate between different types of depression. Some types of depression can also be differentiated based on their causes.</p>
	<p>Below, you will find a list of the different types of depression.</p>
	<h3>Types of depression: minor depression?</h3>
	<p>To speak of a diagnosis ‘minor depression’, at least two of the depression symptoms must be present. This is one of the most common types of depression. A minor depression is a depression on a low-level. One does speak of a depression, but it is less severe than other types of depression.</p>
	<p>The symptoms of depression which must be present in this type, are the standard symptoms of depression. These symptoms can be found under the section symptoms of depression, or in the main article on depression.</p>
	<p>The maximum amount of depression symptoms present in this type of depression is 4 symptoms. If this criterion is surpassed, we are speaking of more severe types of depression. A minor depression thus is a light type of depression, because it only includes a limited amount of depression symptoms.</p>
	<p>This does not mean that the subjective suffering of the person is less or that it should not be treated. Even thought this is a lighter type of depression, the suffering and depressed symptoms can effectively be treated. The lighter the symptoms are and the quicker treatment is sought, effects of this treatment will be seen more quickly.</p>
